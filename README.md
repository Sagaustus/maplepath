# Maplepath

This project was bootstrapped manually to match the default output of `create-next-app` with TypeScript, the App Router, Tailwind CSS, and an `@/*` import alias. It includes accessible theming and internationalisation with English and French translations managed by a lightweight in-house translator.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
